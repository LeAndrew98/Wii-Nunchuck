**November 27 -**
Today is the presentation milestone. Here is a link to my [powerpoint](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/Wii%20Nunchuck.pptx).

**November 20 -**
Today is the enclosure milestone. Today I created a diagram for a [case](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/PiCaseDiagram.pdf) that I would like to be made to enclose my PCB.In terms of the [project schedule](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/CENG317%20Schedule.pdf), I am a little behind scheudle as I need my case to be created. In terms of my [budget](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/CENG317%20Budget.pdf), there has been no changes lately.

**November 13 -**
Today is the power up milestone. I tried to create code that would allow me to read my sensor's values and display them on the screen but I could not produce this code. In terms of the [project schedule](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/CENG317%20Schedule.pdf) I am behind as I was no able to provide code that would display my readings and I will work on getting code to work throughout the week so that I could catch up and be on schedule. In terms of my [budget](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/CENG317%20Budget.pdf), there has been no changes lately.

**November 6 -**
Today was the PCB Soldered milestone. With reference to my [Project Schedule](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/CENG317%20Schedule.pdf), I am a bit behind as I have not finished soldering my PCB. In terms of my [Budget](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/CENG317%20Budget.pdf), other than the wires i mentioned last week, everything is on plan with the budget.I will complete my soldering on Wednesday or Thursday and check to see if everything is okay and I will make sure that I am ready for the hardware demonstration.

**October 30 -**
Today I used Fritzing to create a [PCB](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/WiiNunchuk_pcb.jpg) and a [breadboard](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/WiiNunchuk_bb.jpg) diagram for my sensor.

As for the budget, I had to purchase wires that costed 11 dollars.

**October 23 -**
Today I created the [wiring](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/Wiring.jpg) for my Raspberry Pi and Wii Nunchuk connection. After I finished wiring the connection, I went into the Pi and checked the [i2c device](https://github.com/LeAndrew98/Wii-Nunchuk/blob/master/Documentation/Device.JPG) and made sure that the number that shows up is the correct number.
